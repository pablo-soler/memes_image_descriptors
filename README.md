# Meme descriptors
This is a practice where image descriptors are used to detect whether an input image is a meme or not. Made in a similar way to how Pinterest displays similar images
	
	
The input folder has several images.

The image named with 000.meme.jpg will be the one that works as input to the program

index.py file is the one to be run in python with the folder path

later you can open the showList.html file

You must reload the page when you execute with changes
